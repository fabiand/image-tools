This is a set of tools related to image building for anaconda based
distributions.

This is quite redudndat to imagefactory and livemedia-creator, but it
helps to do CI in Jenkins, where sometimes a fully fledged libvirt
is not available.

The assumptions of this tools are far lower (qemu basically).
